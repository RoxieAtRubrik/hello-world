# Philadelphia

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania’s largest city, is notable for its rich history, on display at the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed) and other American Revolutionary sites. Also iconic are the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, immortalized by Sylvester Stallone’s triumphant run in the film "Rocky."

## To See/Do

* [Liberty Bell](https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories-libertybell.htm)
* Hike to Sunfish Pond: Wear sturdy-soled boots on the rock-studded route to Sunfish Pond, a glacial lake perched at 1,379 feet in the Garden State’s swatch of the Appalachians. The eight-mile round-trip trek on the AT and green-blazed Dunnfield Creek trails plumbs pristine forest made musical by little waterfalls along Dunnfield Creek, which hikers follow for part of the route. At the crystalline spring-fed lake, lounge on rock slabs surrounded by the Appalachians’ time-softened summits.
